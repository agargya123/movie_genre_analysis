##Movie Genre Analysis
With the rise of streaming services, the number of genre tags assigned to a film could possibly impact it's reach and viewership. This project explores if there is an optimal genre_count that maximizes the viewership for a film. If yes, is there a difference in the 'best' count of genres across different genres as well?
<br>
Result = Overall Optimal Number of genres is: 3. 
<br> 
Based on the primary genre - this count may be different e.g - as per our K-means clustering analysis - 
<ul>
  <li>Action : 4 tags</li>
  <li>Comedy : 3 </li>
  <li>Drama : 2</li>
  <li>Documentary: 1 </li>
</ul>
